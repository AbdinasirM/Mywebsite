        <h2>What is <span>coronavirus</span></h2>
        <p class="quote">
            COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019.
            COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever and shortness of breath. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have
            caused death.
            The new coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
            There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. Prevention involves frequent hand-washing, coughing into the bend of
            your elbow and staying home
            when you are sick.

        <h3><span>coronavirus Spread</span></h3>
        <p>
            COVID-19 can be passed from person to person through droplets from coughs and sneezes. COVID-19 has been

            people all over the world,
            and is considered a pandemic.
            The spread of this new coronavirus is being monitored by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World
            Health
            Organization and health organizations like Johns Hopkins across the globe.
